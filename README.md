# Welcome to the Owl Bundle User Group EdgeRater Code Repository

## Files Tracked
Currently we have two files we are tracking in this repository:

## Script File
### OBUG_Scripts.xml
This file contains the source code of all OBUG chart scripts for use in EdgeRater.

It should be copied to your **{Documents}\EdgeRater\Chart Scripts** folder

Then, in EdgeRater open it with the **Chart Script Designer** and save it, this will force the file to be compiled and the compiled DLL will be produced in the  **{Documents}\EdgeRater\Chart Scripts\Compiled2024** folder

Once you have the compiled file, all the scripts will appear in the **Chart Script Library** in the right hand panel within the EdgeRater charting window.

## Templates 
At the moment, only 1 template is being tracked:

### KL_SwingSystems_customV2.xlsx 
This template contains references to the scripts in the **OBUG_Scripts.xml** file, and so you need both the template and the script file in order to be able to run the template in EdgeRater.
